/// The problem:
/// When moving the pointer between 2 MouseRegions, one would trigger an exit event, and the other one an enter event.
/// Let's suppose we have a window and a popup. The pointer exits the window surface and enters the popup surface.
/// When the pointer exits the window surface, this event is propagated to the window and it happens to decide to close
/// the popup even though we moved the pointer on the popup.
///
/// The solution:
/// Don't send the exit event right away. See if an enter event is generated just after.
/// We schedule a asynchronous task for sending an exit event, but if an enter event happens before the next event loop
/// iteration, we cancel the currently scheduled task, thus the exit event will no longer be sent.
