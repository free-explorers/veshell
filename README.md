Veshell is an innovative not-desktop environment for Linux made with modern technologies like Flutter and Rust.

Designed to simplify navigation and reduce the need to manipulate windows in order to improve productivity. It's meant to be 100% predictable.

It provides an [innovative workflow](#the-innovative-workflow) that utilizes humans natural spatial cognition to enhance navigation and organization in the digital environment.

# The innovative workflow

The workflow is designed to synergize with your spatial awareness in order to provide a most intuitive and ergonomic navigation and organization in the digital environment.

Organize all your applications in a two-dimensional space where you can group them by use-cases, categories or or any other criteria that makes sense to you.

The persistence feature automatically saves your layout and organization on-the-fly, so you can build your own configuration that persists even after a reboot by simply using it.

Navigate through your tailored environment with ease, using super intuitive directional inputs inspired by the video game industry.

The Material Design Interface does not only enhances the visual appeal, but also provides an at-a-glance view of the whole layout, allowing for easy navigation with a mouse or touchscreen.

The secret of Veshell lies in two human mental mechanisms:

- **Spatial memory**: The ability to remember the layout of a space and the location of objects within it. This allows us to navigate through familiar environments and find our way back to specific locations.

- **Mental mapping**: The ability to create a mental representation of a space and use it to plan routes and navigate through it.

This allow us to use our wayfinding ability to navigate in a effortless and very pleasant way.
